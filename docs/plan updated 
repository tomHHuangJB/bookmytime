2.1 The Scheduling Pain Points (From Founder's Direct Experience)
As a Linguistic Tutor (Founder's Experience):

Time Waste: Spending 10+ hours monthly on scheduling emails and follow-ups

Payment Hassle: Inconsistent payment methods (PayPal, bank transfers, cash)

Timezone Confusion: International students across 5+ time zones

Client Management: No centralized system for lesson plans, progress tracking

For Other Service Providers:

Booking Friction: Multiple emails/calls to schedule, payment anxiety

Experience Fragmentation: Different tools for scheduling, payments, communication

2.2 Market Gap Analysis
Existing solutions fall into three categories, each with limitations:

Solution Type	Examples	Limitations
Generic Calendars	Calendly, Acuity	Not tailored for service professionals, no community features
Industry-Specific	Tutor-specific platforms	Limited to one vertical, poor UX, outdated technology
DIY Solutions	Google Calendar + PayPal	Fragmented, insecure, manual, no automation
